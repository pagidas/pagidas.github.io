<h3 id="well-where-to-begin">Well, where to begin&hellip;</h3>
<p><em><strong>Saga</strong></em> is a flow of transactions that updates each service and
publishes a message to trigger then next transaction step. This pattern
is not something new. It came from a paper back in <strong>1987</strong></p>
<p>On a very high level, <em><strong>Saga</strong></em> does not use a <em><strong>distributed transaction</strong></em>;
it breaks down the transaction into a series of local transactions in each
one of the participating services.</p>
<p><img src="./images/saga_transaction.jpg" alt="saga_transaction"></p>
<p>Now that <em><strong>microservices</strong></em> architecture is more frequent when orchestrating
a system, plain <code>http request/response</code> communication between microservices can be hard
to maintain. In fact, it increases <em>coupling</em>, because both of the services
need to be <em>available</em> at that specific moment for a flow to happen.
They&rsquo;re bound to the <em>request/response</em> model.</p>
<h3 id="saga-design-challenges">Saga design challenges</h3>
<h4 id="api-design">API design</h4>
<p>Although, a saga internally uses asynchronous communication, the very first step
that starts the saga might be triggered synchronously, via an <em><strong>http request</strong></em> like so</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-http" data-lang="http"><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">P</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">O</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">S</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">T</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"> </span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">/</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">o</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">r</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">d</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">e</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">r</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">s</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></code></pre></div><p>So now we have to cover the issue of <em>when</em> we send back the response.</p>
<h4 id="implementing-rollbacks">Implementing rollbacks</h4>
<p>In a <em><strong>distributed transaction</strong></em> you can execute a <code>rollback</code> statement
that undoes all the updates that have been made so far. But in a saga, given
that we have <em><strong>local transactions</strong></em> in the services required to execute
a flow; if one of the steps fails, the steps required before that have already
committed their changes into their local databases. So we have to explicitly
undo all that.</p>
<h4 id="lacking-the-isolation-property-in-acid----acd">Lacking the Isolation property in ACID &ndash; ACD</h4>
<p>The execution of steps of one saga can interleave with the execution of
steps of other sagas. That may increase database anomalies such as: <em><strong>dirty reads</strong></em>, etc.
So we must use countermeasures such as <em><strong>semantic logging</strong></em>, which means
the <code>state</code> of the <code>Order</code> is <code>PENDING</code> until it becomes <code>APPROVED</code> or <code>REJECTED</code>.</p>
<h3 id="saga-participants-communication">Saga participants communication</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, synchronous communication, such as <em><strong>REST</strong></em>, introduces
<em><strong>temporal coupling</strong></em>, because both client and server need to be available.</p>
<p>So in sagas it makes more sense to be implemented using
<em><strong>asynchronous broker-based messaging collaboration</strong></em> where the participants
communicate through a message broker; that gives us at least once guarantee delivery.</p>
<p><img src="./images/async_broker_based_messaging.jpg" alt="async_broker_based_messaging"></p>
<p>If we have those properties, means that even if a saga participant becomes
unavailable, the message broker is going to keep retrying the delivery of
that message until the other participant will process it. That guarantees
the saga will <em><strong>eventually</strong></em> run to completion.</p>
<h4 id="saga-step">Saga step</h4>
<p>In such fashion, a saga step is a transaction local to a service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service executes a transaction that updates its database</li>
<li>And will also send a message or publish an event</li>
</ul>
<p>That will trigger the next participant in the saga to execute its own
local transaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The interesting thing here is how to make those actions
in a saga step <em><strong>atomically</strong></em> by not using a <em><strong>distributed transaction</strong></em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./images/saga_step.jpg" alt="saga_step"></p>
<h3 id="saga-patterns">Saga patterns</h3>
<p>A <em><strong>Saga</strong></em> is a sequence of transactions, right? And, mentioned earlier,
we saw that communication between those transactions are based upon events.
So the next thought that comes to mind is that, there should be some logic
somewhere that knows what saga step is executed after another
&ndash; either a failed or a successful step.</p>
<p>Here are the two saga patterns based on <em><strong>decision-making</strong></em> aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choreography: <em><strong>distributed</strong></em> decision-making</li>
<li>Orchestration: <em><strong>centralized</strong></em> decision-making</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about them <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html">here</a> ðŸ‘ˆ</p>
<h3 id="putting-a-stop-here">Putting a stop here</h3>
<p>Well this post is not supposed to discuss all the implementation details
and challenges on how to implement sagas. It would be a book to do that,
and there are out there already!</p>
<h2 id="my-demo-app">My demo app</h2>
<p>I wanted to try to implement a saga on my own, using as much <em><strong>lightweight</strong></em>
libraries as I could &ndash; to have more control and get more knowledge.</p>
<p>So the concept is similar to <em><strong>orders-and-customers</strong></em>. The idea is that you
want to order a <em><strong>pantry_item</strong></em> for which you&rsquo;ve put a quantity limit. For example,
you can&rsquo;t have more than 4 pieces of broccoli in your pantry at home.</p>
<p>In that fashion, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>orders</li>
<li>pantry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Orders</strong> is the service where you can create/update orders about <strong>pantry_items</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pantry</strong> is the service that manages if an order about a specific <strong>pantry_item</strong>
has exceeded its limit or not.</p>
<p><img src="./images/demo_architecture_design.jpg" alt="demo_architecture_design"></p>
<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>
<p>As seen in the design picture above, the saga starts with a typical
http request to <em>create a new order</em> The correct way to read the logs is
to take a look at the <em><strong>pantry logs</strong></em> after reading the in the <em><strong>orders logs</strong></em></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Pushing to tpic: order-events message: {...}&quot;
</code></pre><p>After <em><strong>orders</strong></em> publishes a message about the order creation, that&rsquo;s where
<em><strong>pantry</strong></em> starts its lifecycle, consuming that message.</p>
<h4 id="orders-service">Orders service</h4>
<p><img src="./images/orders_logs.png" alt="orders_logs"></p>
<h4 id="pantry-service">Pantry service</h4>
<p><img src="./images/pantry_logs.png" alt="pantry_logs"></p>
<h3 id="github-repo">Github Repo</h3>
<p>My demo <em><strong>orchestration saga</strong></em> is ðŸ‘‡</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/pagidas/kotlin-kafka-choreography-saga
</code></pre><p>I put as much effort as I could to implement it without using heavyweight frameworks.
So it&rsquo;s all out there, explicitly, from the <em><strong>kafka consumers/producers</strong></em>, basic
<em><strong>jdbc</strong></em> for <em><strong>postgresql</strong></em>, up to simple <em><strong>web controllers</strong></em>. The only fancy bit
might be the use of <em><strong>Kotlin</strong></em> which I find myself playing around with lately.</p>
<p>I think my demo app, along with the talk I&rsquo;m referencing down below, could be a great start to
get your hands in <em><strong>sagas</strong></em> and their challenges</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, folks, I hope you enjoyed!</p>

            <title>A very easy-to-wire-up distributed lock solution for scheduled tasks</title>
            <link>https://pagidas.github.io/posts/shedlock_poc/</link>

            <description>Shedlock is a very well documented library and has already integrated with SpringBoot and Micronaut way of setting a scheduled task. Usually, these kind of frameworks can schedule a task with just simply applying a decorator/annotation like so @Scheduled on top of your java method.
Deploying a SpringBoot application or a Micronaut (nowadays) into an orchestration platform like Kubernetes usually brings some issues; these scheduled tasks are bound to the container/vm they&amp;rsquo;re running into.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock">Shedlock</a>
is a very well documented library and has already integrated with
<a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">SpringBoot</a>
and <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a> way of setting a scheduled task.
Usually, these kind of frameworks can schedule a task with just simply
applying a decorator/annotation like so <code>@Scheduled</code> on top of your java
method.</p>
<p>Deploying a <code>SpringBoot</code> application or a <code>Micronaut</code> (nowadays) into an
orchestration platform like <em><strong>Kubernetes</strong></em> usually brings some issues;
these scheduled tasks are bound to the container/vm they&rsquo;re running into.
Meaning that, if we have <code>3 replicas</code> of that service that executes a
<code>@Scheduled</code> task, we will experience that task executing <code>3</code> times &ndash; once per <code>replica</code> of a container.</p>
<p>On a recent task of mine to implement a scheduled task at my work
which would call a third-party api to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch some data</li>
<li>update some other</li>
<li>and report (after calling again and checking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, we wouldn&rsquo;t want our scheduled task to execute these routines
as many times as the <code>replica number</code> of the container inside the Kubernetes cluster.
Hence, a colleague of mine introduced me to <code>Shedlock</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <em><strong>Shedlock</strong></em> already has support on <em><strong>SpringBoot</strong></em>
and <em><strong>Micronaut</strong></em> so to make it work was no pain at all. The only dependency
required is a <code>DataSource</code> &ndash; a DB, cache, etc. The list of all the datastores
that it supports is right <a href="https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock#configure-lockprovider">here</a></p>
<pre><code>Mongo
Redis
ElasticSearch
Cassandra
...
and many more!
</code></pre><p>On a high level, <em><strong>Shedlock</strong></em> creates an index/table where the <code>id</code> of the scheduled
task is <em>locked</em>, and it will make sure that only one of the instances
will execute the scheduled task. Of course, if one of the instances will fail for any reason,
the lock will be released for the next available!</p>
<p><img src="./images/shedlock_high_level.png" alt="high_level_architecture_diagram"></p>
<p><em><strong>Shedlock</strong></em> needs just another <code>annotation</code> on top of your scheduled task as follows in my example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#a6e22e">@Scheduled</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>fixedDelay <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;5s&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span>

<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>along with some extra configuration in <code>application.yml</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#66d9ef">shedlock</span>:

<p>Well, <em>Charlie</em> was telling his friend, <em>Will</em>, that in the old days
they did the news well; how? They just decided to.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not going to do any news, nor I will try to teach anything
to anybody. I&rsquo;m really new to this.
This blog is my attempt to self reflect on the things I&rsquo;m
learning throughout my development in software engineering. That does not
mean I&rsquo;m going to just be talking about tech. I will try to bring other
aspects of my life as well.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Note to self:</em></p>
<p>I will try my best and jot down blog posts of thoughts and experiments
in the tech world.</p>
<p><em>As I&rsquo;m writing, I&rsquo;m thinking of how this whole <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
project is going to be distributed in some corner of the web.</em></p>
<p>I guess if you ever have the change to read this very blog, means that
I&rsquo;ve done this successfully! ðŸ˜Œ</p>
