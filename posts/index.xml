            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it all began when I moved to another team within the same company.
This colleague of mine, when I asked him how the team was like, etc, he said
to me in the end, &ldquo;we use the hexagonal architecture here, and you&rsquo;ll see
how much power it gives you.&rdquo; Back then, I knew little about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID"><strong><em>SOLID</em></strong></a> principles, which
is an acronym about best practices in OOP, heavily promoted by
<a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">Uncle Bob</a>.
Not a long later, I found out how all of these so-called
best practices were mentioned back in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The ports and adapters pattern is an architectural pattern invented by
<a href="https://alistair.cockburn.us/coming-soon/">Alistair Cockburn</a>;
you can read all about it <a href="https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/">here</a> ðŸ‘ˆ
It aims at creating loosely coupled application components, that can fix
undesired dependencies, and domain logic leaking into the user interface
and vice-versa.</p>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p><strong><em>Hexagon</em></strong> is our core domain logic that should be isolated from
the outside world. It should ideally contain no technology-specific
dependencies; only very lightweight libraries that help with the complexity
of the domain.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ports</em></strong> are the interfaces defined, with their respective models,
to separate the application components.</p>
<p><strong><em>Adapters</em></strong> are the components that adapt the technology to the interface (port).</p>
<p>There are at two types of ports, as well as adapters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Driving</em></strong> ports: interfaces defining how the application is triggered.</li>
<li><strong><em>Driven</em></strong> ports: interfaces defining how the application communicates with
the external world.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above fashion, the same goes with the driving/driven adapters</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we have our <strong><em>hexagon</em></strong> (domain logic) component which
we want to isolate from the outside world via well-defined <strong><em>ports</em></strong> (interfaces),
which are then implemented/used by <strong><em>adapter</em></strong> components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note that the above statement does not encompass all, so make sure you read
the link to the original pattern if questions arise.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-it-relates-to-solid">How it relates to SOLID</h2>
<p>The ports and adapters pattern enforces one the <strong><em>SOLID</em></strong> principles due
to its glossary. <strong><em>Dependency Inversion</em></strong> principle, which states</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should
depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details
should depend on abstractions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to clarify is that the dependency direction is not affected when
applying the above principle; but, because of introducing an abstraction between them,
we end up with two different dependencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>the high-level module depends on the abstraction.</li>
<li>the low-level module depends on <strong><em>that same</em></strong> abstraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependency inversion principle follows naturally when we
apply <strong><em>Open/closed</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Liskov substitution</em></strong> principles.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Open/closed</em></strong> principle requires a software component to be open for
extension and closed for modification. We can achieve that by introducing an
abstraction for which we can derive different components. An interface itself
is closed for modification, but we can extend it by providing new implementations.</p>
<p>Our implementations on the above principle should follow the <strong><em>Liskov substitution</em></strong>
principle so that we can replace implementations of an abstraction without
affecting the behaviour of the application. We can verify this principle when
our tests exercise the <strong><em>behaviour</em></strong> and not implementation details.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-application">Building an application</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try and build an application to understand more about the pattern.
The theme of the application will be a sort of card wallet software, which can:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a wallet</li>
<li>list all wallets</li>
<li>add a pass*</li>
<li>debit a pass*</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Pass</code>* - a pass for this example is like those club cards in a super-market containing points.</p>
<h3 id="design-phase">Design phase</h3>
<p>My initial attempt to draw out the application ended up quite ineffective, but we are here
to learn, so I will include them in order to express my thoughts.</p>
<p><img src="images/initial_design.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Now for &ldquo;architectural design&rdquo; <strong><em>V1</em></strong>, there is not really <em>any</em> architecture.
Not only that but I stared at it confusingly, thinking of what will be my next steps,
until I had reached to a point where I started adding things that became my <strong><em>V2</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I see this <strong><em>WebController</em></strong> that makes me think that there is some kind of web
technology that is associated to the <strong><em>CardWalletLogic</em></strong>. Ok, maybe it <em>uses</em>
the logic component. So this is probably an HTTP component that when called
it uses the logic component, which is supposed to be our main application. Then
we have another thing there, <strong><em>DB</em></strong> which is <em>used</em> by our <strong><em>CardWalletLogic</em></strong>,
reading/writing data to complete the functionality.</p>
<p><strong><em>V2</em></strong> seems to be like an architectural design, but the thing that bothers me
is that out of my confusion, I took technology decisions, only because of my
inability to continue on designing the application. I also had thoughts on
how would I test this out; I would need an HTTP server running,
or I would mock it out; have a db up and running, or again mock it out.
All in all, I felt I did not have a design that would help me start coding.</p>
<p>With a bit more focus on the ports and adapters pattern, I came up with the next
version of the design.</p>
<p><img src="images/abstractions_design.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Trying to make sense of the pattern, I drew two interfaces
(ports in the glossary of the pattern)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CardWalletPort</code> - driving port.</li>
<li><code>CardWalletStorage</code> - driven port.</li>
</ul>
<p>One that defines how to communicate with the card wallet domain component,
and one that the domain <em>uses</em> to finish the functionality.
That leaves us with <code>CardWalletLogic</code> to be an implementation detail,
which is <em>derived</em> from the interface that defines the shape of
the domain logic component(the hexagon).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For those who do not know already, the filled arrow is a derived association
(extends) and the empty arrow is a direct association (uses, has, etc.).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this design, I felt much more confident. It also reminded me that
regardless of what things are out of both interfaces (ports)
I could safely - and I ought to - start implementing the behaviour
of the card wallet domain first.</p>
<p>But I did not, yet!</p>
<p>My curiosity of my previous mistakes wanted me to
try and visualize the design with both the abstractions and the technology
choices I made in the last version.</p>
<p><img src="images/not_clear_boundaries_design.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>It took a bit of time to draw out the correct associations, but I made it.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CardWalletWebController</code> - driving adapter.</li>
<li><code>DatabaseApi</code> - driven adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>CardWalletWebController</code> wraps the card wallet domain component
via the port, which means it <em>has an instance</em> of that interface,
and adapts HTTP-specific things to it. This is called an adapter
in the ports and adapters pattern, because it uses the
<em>adapter software design pattern</em>. Simple, right?
The other adapter is the <code>DatabaseApi</code> which derives from the
dependency port of card wallet domain component, adapting domain
logic into database-specific, acting as the depepdency port itself.</p>
<p>Another thing that I struggled to grasp is that the pattern talks about
<em>loosely coupled application components that stop undesired dependencies,
and contamination of domain logic into the user interface and vice-versa</em>.
From my last version of the design, I could definitely see the &ldquo;loosely coupling&rdquo;
being introduced because of the abstractions in place (ports). What I could not
clearly depict, was the <em>components</em>. There was no clear separation of components,
i.e. component modularity.</p>
<p><img src="images/boundaries_design.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>In the (hopefully) last design version, I attempted to clearly
place the boundaries so that I could understand the dependencies.
The design depicts three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>the card wallet domain component (hexagon)</li>
<li>the HTTP adapter component (driving adapter)</li>
<li>the database adapter component (driven adapter)</li>
</ul>
<p>These three components should ideally be three separate modules with their
own local concerns and dependencies. The design implies that whatever
changes may happen to adapter modules will not affect the domain module (hexagon).
This information is understood by the arrowed lines that, crossing the boundaries,
they point to the same direction, to the most important part of the system.
The domain logic. The high-level module, card wallet domain, does not directly
depend on the low-level modules, the adapters, but on abstractions.
Also, the low-level modules do not directly depend on the high-level module&rsquo;s
implementation details, but on the domain api.</p>
<h3 id="coding-phase">Coding phase</h3>
<p>Let us start by defining the port responsible to talk to our domain component.</p>
<p>We will focus on the wallet creation capability of the application; but
we can pair it with the list all wallets functionality so that we can test
the behaviour solely via the interface.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>If we remember the ports and adapters pattern, it defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>driving ports/adapters</li>
<li>driven ports/adapters</li>
</ul>
<p>The test we wrote in the above block of code, is essentially a
<strong><em>driving adapter</em></strong>; it drives/triggers the domain logic component.
It is &ldquo;driving&rdquo; because it targets the driving port, and &ldquo;adapter&rdquo; because it
asserts the interface is behaving correctly, by running the framework&rsquo;s rules
engine upon results when delegating calls to the interface.</p>
<p>Now that we have defined the functionality in the port and a ðŸ’¥ failing test
ready to go; let us start implementing the hexagon.</p>

}
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p><em>For simplicity, internals of <code>CardWalletLogic</code> are not included in the demo
(there will be a link to the GitHub repository)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For creating a wallet, we have decided to persist the results into some storage;
and so we define a driven port as it is an external concern.</p>
<p><code>toDto()</code> function maps the domain object&rsquo;s model to a data transfer model. This
is crucial, so we do not end up leaking domain knowledge out of the hexagon.
If we have a rich domain, and we choose to spread it across domain
objects, those models must not be part of the api (driving or driven ports),
rather they should be implementation details of the very hexagon.
That leaves us using simple data structures for entering or exiting the hexagon.</p>
<p>Of course, we now need to verify that the domain logic we have coded complies
with the test we have written in the beginning. The test exercises the behaviour
of the wallet creation functionality.</p>

<p>There is an idea behind making sure to test the behaviour of an api
rather than its implementation details due to their nature of changing
more frequently. The move value we add to that single test suite, the
more important it becomes to make sure all adapters comply with it.</p>

            <description>Lately&amp;hellip; Not a new thing, but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to focus more on testing the behaviour of an application rather than its implementation details. Those details are variable; so our behavioural test (Integration test?) shouldn&amp;rsquo;t depend on them.
For example if our application exposes a RESTful CRUD api, storing the resource into some database &amp;ndash; changing the library used to connect to the database and run queries at it, must not change the fact that our application should still behave the same.</description>

<p>Not a new thing, but lately I&rsquo;ve been trying to focus more on testing the behaviour of an
application rather than its implementation details. Those details are variable; so our
behavioural test (Integration test?) shouldn&rsquo;t depend on them.</p>
<p>For example if our application exposes a RESTful CRUD api, storing the resource into
some database &ndash; changing the library used to connect to the database and run queries at it,
must not change the fact that our application should still behave the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of <em>mocking</em> external dependencies into my tests, especially if the application
is heavy on them. I prefer a &ldquo;test through the wire&rdquo;, one that does a real connection.</p>
<p>It feels like a <code>docker-compose</code> context would be perfect for such testing&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope you know this already, but if you don&rsquo;t, there is a very interesting library
wrapping <em><strong>Docker</strong></em> commands, which we can use to set our environment with docker containers
ready for our testing. And all that programmatically within our test source code.
And, yes, of course I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">Testcontainers</a></p>
<h3 id="my-demo-app">My Demo app</h3>
<p>For the sake of this blog post, the demo application I&rsquo;ve designed has
a variety of dependencies that makes it a bit hard to test overall.</p>
<p>On a high level, we have a <em><strong>streaming application</strong></em> that processes events
about files which we need to download from an external api, and then save them
into an <em><strong>AWS S3</strong></em> bucket.</p>
<p>The technology I used for the application above is <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>,
and specifically I used the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation/streams/developer-guide/processor-api.html">Processor API</a>
to create a <em><strong>processor topology</strong></em> to represent my business logic.</p>
<p>For demoing purposes, the external api from which I download the file to continue the flow,
I used the <a href="https://www.file.io/">file.io</a> &ndash; in reality it could be any third-party provider.</p>
<h4 id="topology-graph">Topology graph</h4>
<p>Our <em><strong>topology graph</strong></em> looks like this
<img src="images/stream_processing_topology_graph.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Quite simple, right?</p>
<p>In code, the DSL describing the above topology is even simpler, once you get
your hands around <em><strong>Kafka</strong></em></p>

<h4 id="setting-up-testcontainers">Setting up Testcontainers</h4>
<p>First is our gradle imports, and <em><strong>Testcontainers</strong></em> thankfully provides us with a <em><strong>bom</strong></em> we can use,
so we can have the same version across all libraries for no conflicts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">implementation platform(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;org.testcontainers:testcontainers-bom:$testContainersVersion&#34;</span>)
testImplementation <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;org.testcontainers:kafka&#34;</span>
testImplementation <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;org.testcontainers:mockserver&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>They do also provide specific containers of widely used technologies to abstract the way we spin them up.</p>
<p>As seen above <code>org.testcontainers:kafka</code> and <code>org.testcontainers:mockserver</code>.</p>
<p>For other containers that there is no specific module, we can of course use the <code>GenericContainer</code>
which works as expected, the same way you&rsquo;d create and run an instance of a docker container.</p>
<p>There are two ways we can use <em><strong>Testcontainers</strong></em> functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can let the library handle the containers&rsquo; lifecycle</li>
<li>Or we can control it manually.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the automated containers&rsquo; lifecycle control, we have to import another module:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">testImplementation <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter:$junit5Version&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This adds some annotations where we can use to declare containers that are maintained by the library &ndash; <code>@Container</code>.</p>
<p>In our own example I use the manual approach to have singleton containers.
You can read more about the <em><strong>JUnit5 support</strong></em> <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/test_framework_integration/junit_5/">here</a> ðŸ‘ˆ</p>
<p>To setup singleton containers with manual lifecycle control, we have to follow a <em><strong>base class</strong></em> pattern:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin"><span style="color:#66d9ef">open</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">TestContainersBase</span> {

            <span style="color:#75715e">// start your containers
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>            <span style="color:#75715e">// plus whatever is needed for the context to load properly
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Note how we declare containers that are supported by the framework, and also containers using the <code>GenericContainer</code> type.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin"><span style="color:#66d9ef">private</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">val</span> kafkaContainer = KafkaContainer(DockerImageName.parse(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;confluentinc/cp-kafka:5.4.3&#34;</span>)).apply { 
    withExposedPorts(KAFKA_CONTAINER_PORT)
}
<span style="color:#66d9ef">private</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">val</span> mockServerContainer = MockServerContainer(DockerImageName.parse(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mockserver/mockserver&#34;</span>)).apply {

}
<span style="color:#66d9ef">private</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">val</span> s3MockContainer = GenericContainer&lt;Nothing&gt;(DockerImageName.parse(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;adobe/s3mock&#34;</span>)).apply {
    withExposedPorts(S3_MOCK_CONTAINER_PORT)
    withEnv(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;initialBuckets&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;file-uploads&#34;</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>To test that we upload to <em><strong>AWS S3</strong></em> I used <a href="https://github.com/adobe/S3Mock">S3Mock</a>
but we could use <a href="https://github.com/localstack/localstack">LocalStack</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, to test we download the file
from a third-party api, I used <a href="https://www.mock-server.com/">MockServer</a> but another good alternative is <a href="http://wiremock.org/">Wiremock</a>.
Both of those solutions we can add pairs of <code>request/response</code> expectations, which sounds like <em>mocking</em>, yet it isn&rsquo;t.
They both run a real <code>http</code> server.</p>
<p>Our <code>init {}</code> would simply look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">init {
    <span style="color:#75715e">// init containers
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    kafkaContainer.start()
    mockServerContainer.start()
    s3MockContainer.start()
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now you may wonder how do we connect to those docker containers when they are started&hellip;</p>
<p>We already exposed the ports when we declared the containers in the example up above, but those are not the ports that are actually mapped
into our <code>localhost</code>. Rather, <em><strong>Testcontainers</strong></em> actually exposes them on random free ones to avoid port collisions.</p>
<p>At runtime, we can ask <em><strong>Testcontainers</strong></em> what is the actual mapped port given the port of the container we declared, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">s3MockContainer.getMappedPort(S3_MOCK_CONTAINER_PORT)
</code></pre></div><p>As soon as we have the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> that our docker containers run at, the only thing we are left
to do is just pass them into our application&rsquo;s config via environment, so we can start testing the behaviour
of our application.</p>

<h3 id="well-where-to-begin">Well, where to begin&hellip;</h3>
<p><em><strong>Saga</strong></em> is a flow of transactions that updates each service and
publishes a message to trigger then next transaction step. This pattern
is not something new. It came from a paper back in <strong>1987</strong></p>
<p>On a very high level, <em><strong>Saga</strong></em> does not use a <em><strong>distributed transaction</strong></em>;
it breaks down the transaction into a series of local transactions in each
one of the participating services.</p>
<p><img src="./images/saga_transaction.jpg" alt="saga_transaction"></p>
<p>Now that <em><strong>microservices</strong></em> architecture is more frequent when orchestrating
a system, plain <code>http request/response</code> communication between microservices can be hard
to maintain. In fact, it increases <em>coupling</em>, because both of the services
need to be <em>available</em> at that specific moment for a flow to happen.
They&rsquo;re bound to the <em>request/response</em> model.</p>
<h3 id="saga-design-challenges">Saga design challenges</h3>
<h4 id="api-design">API design</h4>
<p>Although, a saga internally uses asynchronous communication, the very first step
that starts the saga might be triggered synchronously, via an <em><strong>http request</strong></em> like so</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-http" data-lang="http"><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">P</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">O</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">S</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">T</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010"> </span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">/</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">o</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">r</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">d</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">e</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">r</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">s</span><span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">
</span></code></pre></div><p>So now we have to cover the issue of <em>when</em> we send back the response.</p>
<h4 id="implementing-rollbacks">Implementing rollbacks</h4>
<p>In a <em><strong>distributed transaction</strong></em> you can execute a <code>rollback</code> statement
that undoes all the updates that have been made so far. But in a saga, given
that we have <em><strong>local transactions</strong></em> in the services required to execute
a flow; if one of the steps fails, the steps required before that have already
committed their changes into their local databases. So we have to explicitly
undo all that.</p>
<h4 id="lacking-the-isolation-property-in-acid----acd">Lacking the Isolation property in ACID &ndash; ACD</h4>
<p>The execution of steps of one saga can interleave with the execution of
steps of other sagas. That may increase database anomalies such as: <em><strong>dirty reads</strong></em>, etc.
So we must use countermeasures such as <em><strong>semantic logging</strong></em>, which means
the <code>state</code> of the <code>Order</code> is <code>PENDING</code> until it becomes <code>APPROVED</code> or <code>REJECTED</code>.</p>
<h3 id="saga-participants-communication">Saga participants communication</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, synchronous communication, such as <em><strong>REST</strong></em>, introduces
<em><strong>temporal coupling</strong></em>, because both client and server need to be available.</p>
<p>So in sagas it makes more sense to be implemented using
<em><strong>asynchronous broker-based messaging collaboration</strong></em> where the participants
communicate through a message broker; that gives us at least once guarantee delivery.</p>
<p><img src="./images/async_broker_based_messaging.jpg" alt="async_broker_based_messaging"></p>
<p>If we have those properties, means that even if a saga participant becomes
unavailable, the message broker is going to keep retrying the delivery of
that message until the other participant will process it. That guarantees
the saga will <em><strong>eventually</strong></em> run to completion.</p>
<h4 id="saga-step">Saga step</h4>
<p>In such fashion, a saga step is a transaction local to a service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service executes a transaction that updates its database</li>
<li>And will also send a message or publish an event</li>
</ul>
<p>That will trigger the next participant in the saga to execute its own
local transaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The interesting thing here is how to make those actions
in a saga step <em><strong>atomically</strong></em> by not using a <em><strong>distributed transaction</strong></em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./images/saga_step.jpg" alt="saga_step"></p>
<h3 id="saga-patterns">Saga patterns</h3>
<p>A <em><strong>Saga</strong></em> is a sequence of transactions, right? And, mentioned earlier,
we saw that communication between those transactions are based upon events.
So the next thought that comes to mind is that, there should be some logic
somewhere that knows what saga step is executed after another
&ndash; either a failed or a successful step.</p>
<p>Here are the two saga patterns based on <em><strong>decision-making</strong></em> aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choreography: <em><strong>distributed</strong></em> decision-making</li>
<li>Orchestration: <em><strong>centralized</strong></em> decision-making</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about them <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html">here</a> ðŸ‘ˆ</p>
<h3 id="putting-a-stop-here">Putting a stop here</h3>
<p>Well this post is not supposed to discuss all the implementation details
and challenges on how to implement sagas. It would be a book to do that,
and there are out there already!</p>
<h2 id="my-demo-app">My demo app</h2>
<p>I wanted to try to implement a saga on my own, using as much <em><strong>lightweight</strong></em>
libraries as I could &ndash; to have more control and get more knowledge.</p>
<p>So the concept is similar to <em><strong>orders-and-customers</strong></em>. The idea is that you
want to order a <em><strong>pantry_item</strong></em> for which you&rsquo;ve put a quantity limit. For example,
you can&rsquo;t have more than 4 pieces of broccoli in your pantry at home.</p>
<p>In that fashion, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>orders</li>
<li>pantry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Orders</strong> is the service where you can create/update orders about <strong>pantry_items</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pantry</strong> is the service that manages if an order about a specific <strong>pantry_item</strong>
has exceeded its limit or not.</p>
<p><img src="./images/demo_architecture_design.jpg" alt="demo_architecture_design"></p>
<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>
<p>As seen in the design picture above, the saga starts with a typical
http request to <em>create a new order</em> The correct way to read the logs is
to take a look at the <em><strong>pantry logs</strong></em> after reading the in the <em><strong>orders logs</strong></em></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Pushing to tpic: order-events message: {...}&quot;
</code></pre><p>After <em><strong>orders</strong></em> publishes a message about the order creation, that&rsquo;s where
<em><strong>pantry</strong></em> starts its lifecycle, consuming that message.</p>
<h4 id="orders-service">Orders service</h4>
<p><img src="./images/orders_logs.png" alt="orders_logs"></p>
<h4 id="pantry-service">Pantry service</h4>
<p><img src="./images/pantry_logs.png" alt="pantry_logs"></p>
<h3 id="github-repo">Github Repo</h3>
<p>My demo <em><strong>orchestration saga</strong></em> is ðŸ‘‡</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/pagidas/kotlin-kafka-choreography-saga
</code></pre><p>I put as much effort as I could to implement it without using heavyweight frameworks.
So it&rsquo;s all out there, explicitly, from the <em><strong>kafka consumers/producers</strong></em>, basic
<em><strong>jdbc</strong></em> for <em><strong>postgresql</strong></em>, up to simple <em><strong>web controllers</strong></em>. The only fancy bit
might be the use of <em><strong>Kotlin</strong></em> which I find myself playing around with lately.</p>
<p>I think my demo app, along with the talk I&rsquo;m referencing down below, could be a great start to
get your hands in <em><strong>sagas</strong></em> and their challenges</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, folks, I hope you enjoyed!</p>

            <description>Shedlock is a very well documented library and has already integrated with SpringBoot and Micronaut way of setting a scheduled task. Usually, these kind of frameworks can schedule a task with just simply applying a decorator/annotation like so @Scheduled on top of your java method.
Deploying a SpringBoot application or a Micronaut (nowadays) into an orchestration platform like Kubernetes usually brings some issues; these scheduled tasks are bound to the container/vm they&amp;rsquo;re running into.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock">Shedlock</a>
is a very well documented library and has already integrated with
<a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">SpringBoot</a>
and <a href="https://micronaut.io/">Micronaut</a> way of setting a scheduled task.
Usually, these kind of frameworks can schedule a task with just simply
applying a decorator/annotation like so <code>@Scheduled</code> on top of your java
method.</p>
<p>Deploying a <code>SpringBoot</code> application or a <code>Micronaut</code> (nowadays) into an
orchestration platform like <em><strong>Kubernetes</strong></em> usually brings some issues;
these scheduled tasks are bound to the container/vm they&rsquo;re running into.
Meaning that, if we have <code>3 replicas</code> of that service that executes a
<code>@Scheduled</code> task, we will experience that task executing <code>3</code> times &ndash; once per <code>replica</code> of a container.</p>
<p>On a recent task of mine to implement a scheduled task at my work
which would call a third-party api to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch some data</li>
<li>update some other</li>
<li>and report (after calling again and checking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, we wouldn&rsquo;t want our scheduled task to execute these routines
as many times as the <code>replica number</code> of the container inside the Kubernetes cluster.
Hence, a colleague of mine introduced me to <code>Shedlock</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <em><strong>Shedlock</strong></em> already has support on <em><strong>SpringBoot</strong></em>
and <em><strong>Micronaut</strong></em> so to make it work was no pain at all. The only dependency
required is a <code>DataSource</code> &ndash; a DB, cache, etc. The list of all the datastores
that it supports is right <a href="https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock#configure-lockprovider">here</a></p>
<pre><code>Mongo
Redis
ElasticSearch
Cassandra
...
and many more!
</code></pre><p>On a high level, <em><strong>Shedlock</strong></em> creates an index/table where the <code>id</code> of the scheduled
task is <em>locked</em>, and it will make sure that only one of the instances
will execute the scheduled task. Of course, if one of the instances will fail for any reason,
the lock will be released for the next available!</p>

<p><em><strong>Shedlock</strong></em> needs just another <code>annotation</code> on top of your scheduled task as follows in my example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#a6e22e">@Scheduled</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>fixedDelay <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;5s&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
<span style="color:#a6e22e">@SchedulerLock</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>name <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;say-hello-scheduler&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">schedule</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
    assertLocked<span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
    log<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">info</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello from {}&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">,</span> App<span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">getName</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>along with some extra configuration in <code>application.yml</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#66d9ef">shedlock</span>:
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">defaults</span>:
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">lock-at-most-for</span>: 8s
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">lock-at-least-for</span>: 5s
</code></pre></div><p>Now the <code>@Scheduled</code> expects a <code>LockProvider</code> to be declared somewhere. Thus, in my example
where I used <code>Elasticsearch</code> as my datastore, we would have factory bean method like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span style="color:#a6e22e">@Factory</span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">SchedulingLockConfiguration</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
    
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">@Singleton</span>
    LockProvider <span style="color:#a6e22e">lockProvider</span><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>RestHighLevelClient client<span style="color:#f92672">)</span> <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">new</span> ElasticsearchLockProvider<span style="color:#f92672">(</span>client<span style="color:#f92672">)</span><span style="color:#f92672">;</span>
    <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In the docs of the library you can find factory bean methods for all the
datastores that currently the library is integrated and supports to build
the lock.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the output logs of a demo PoC I did</p>
<p><img src="./images/proof.png" alt="proof"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! I hope this blog helped&hellip;</p>
<p>The repo can be found right here</p>

<p>Well, <em>Charlie</em> was telling his friend, <em>Will</em>, that in the old days
they did the news well; how? They just decided to.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not going to do any news, nor I will try to teach anything
to anybody. I&rsquo;m really new to this.
This blog is my attempt to self reflect on the things I&rsquo;m
learning throughout my development in software engineering. That does not
mean I&rsquo;m going to just be talking about tech. I will try to bring other
aspects of my life as well.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Note to self:</em></p>
<p>I will try my best and jot down blog posts of thoughts and experiments
in the tech world.</p>
<p><em>As I&rsquo;m writing, I&rsquo;m thinking of how this whole <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
project is going to be distributed in some corner of the web.</em></p>
<p>I guess if you ever have the change to read this very blog, means that
I&rsquo;ve done this successfully! ðŸ˜Œ</p>
