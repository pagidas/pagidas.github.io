      <description>Shedlock is a very well documented library and has already integrated with SpringBoot and Micronaut way of setting a scheduled task. Usually, these kind of frameworks can schedule a task with just simply applying a decorator/annotation like so @Scheduled on top of your java method.
Deploying a SpringBoot application or a Micronaut (nowadays) into an orchestration platform like Kubernetes usually brings some issues; these scheduled tasks are bound to the container/vm they&amp;rsquo;re running into.</description>

      <description>We just decided to &amp;ndash; Charlie, The Newsroom, TV Series 2012-2014
 Well, Charlie was telling his friend, Will, that in the old days they did the news well; how? They just decided to.
However, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do any news, nor I will try to teach anything to anybody. I&amp;rsquo;m really new to this. This blog is my attempt to self reflect on the things I&amp;rsquo;m learning throughout my development in software engineering.</description>

      <description>About Hello, world! My name is Kostas Akrivos; I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer from Thessaloniki, Greece; currently based in London, UK.
 I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about technology, and always curious about new tools that help you build a piece of software. I attended a BSc Computer Science in University of Bangor, Wales which I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish in the end. I had other things in mind that time; things I still hold on to in order to keep my creativity juices up.</description>
