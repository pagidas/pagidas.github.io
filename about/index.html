<h4 id="hello-world">Hello, world!</h4>
<p>My name is Kostas Akrivos; I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer from Thessaloniki, Greece;
currently based in London, UK.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about technology, and always curious about new tools that
help you build a piece of software. I attended a <em><strong>BSc Computer Science</strong></em>
in <em><strong>University of Bangor, Wales</strong></em> which I didn&rsquo;t finish in the end. I had
other things in mind that time; things I still hold on to in order to keep
my creativity juices up. After some time, trying to learn about the world,
doing different things &ndash; work, hobbies &ndash; I decided to catch up on software
development once again. Ideas of small apps never left my mind unoccupied.
So I started a <em><strong>Full-Stack Software Developer Coding Bootcamp</strong></em> in
Athens, Greece, which made me thinking even more about software development.
And up to this point, I still work professionally as a Software Engineer in
London, UK.</p>
<p>Although the coding bootcamp I took part in involved around both front-end
and back-end, I&rsquo;m way more experienced in the back-end; but that&rsquo;s not an
excuse to not teach yourself about front-end technologies! (I&rsquo;ve done some
basic React tutorials and built some small apps). The ecosystem in which I&rsquo;m
more comfortable with is the <em><strong>JVM</strong></em>. Lately I find myself digging more into
<em><strong>Kotlin</strong></em> as I believe that, because it offers multiple coding paradigms,
you can be more flexible when it comes to implementing a solution.</p>
<p>Aside from software development; I enjoy taking pictures with a trusty
point-and-shoot <em><strong>fujifilm</strong></em> camera; some other times I might pick up
my heavier <em><strong>Canon</strong></em> camera to shoot some short videos, which I edit
on various of software; I love sailing when I find the time; oh, and I used
to play the drums for about 7 years, but it&rsquo;s been a long time that last time
I played.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me ðŸ˜„</p>
